    I started to make this program after watching Adam Koury's "Flat Icons HTML Code Symbols Discovery JAvascript"
    you can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G-XFiAHtpU, not sure he is still making videos, this one
    is 8 years old, so i want to thank Adam Koury for the inspiration to write this.
    
    I will be considering this program a work in progress, i have lots of ideas for it, just not sure i have the time
    to implement them all, enjoy this program and do with it as you will, spread the good news, take care and God Bless.
